**UniSuper has some [450,000 members](https://www.unisuper.com.au/your-super/introduction-to-unisuper), is one of Australia’s largest super funds, and manages around [$80 billion](https://www.unisuper.com.au/about-us/who-we-are) in retirement savings.**

UniSuper’s divestment from fossil-fuels would therefore represent the effective removal of some $80 billion from the pool of investments available to the fossil-fuel industry. This is an enormous pool in potential loans to companies that make money by destroying the environment.

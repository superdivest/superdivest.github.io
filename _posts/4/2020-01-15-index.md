**‘Sustainable Options’ are a marketing tool.**

‘Sustainable Options’ are a means of avoiding complete divestment from industries with poor reputations. Put simply, they are a commercial risk management strategy directed toward altering members’ perceptions of a fund rather than changing the actual impact of its investments. ‘Options’ still contribute to the administration costs of a fund’s other investment bundles, and ‘administration costs’ can be either undisclosed or so vaguely described as to eliminate any meaningful distinction between ‘options.’  Options within a fund do not represent divestment by that fund.

Over 60% of UniSuper’s ‘Sustainable Balanced’ investments are undisclosed.

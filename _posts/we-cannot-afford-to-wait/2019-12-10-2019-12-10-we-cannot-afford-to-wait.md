Our federal government isn't required to go to the polls til May 2022: that's nearly 900 more days of likely climate inaction. [Join the call](https://www.change.org/p/david-hurley-governor-general-calling-on-the-governor-general-to-dissolve-the-house?recruiter=13046551) to dissolve parliament due to their long standing inaction and denial of the science behind Climate Change.

Consider our greenhouse gas projections on the graph: Australia is still not on track to meet its woefully inadequate 2030 emissions reduction target. The longer we take to start cleaning up our act the steeper the slide will need to be.

The Northern Territory is already cooking: we cannot afford to wait for the substantial climate action we need. Yesterday Darwin broke their December max temperature record at 37.1C, and last Saturday, the Victoria River Downs suffered under a whopping 44.7C: their hottest December day since records began in 1965.

Investing in ‘green’ energy is not enough to cut emissions.

Adding renewables does not in and of itself reduce emissions; this requires removal of fossil fuels. Sustainable options allow funds to grow their portfolio such that renewables become additional to, rather than a substitute for, high emissions investments. Addressing climate change requires withdrawal of these investments rather than merely their supplementation with other power sources.

Divestment from fossil-fuel industries cannot be accomplished at an individual level. 

Firstly, UniSuper’s pool of funds is locked in due to Enterprise Bargaining Agreements struck between the National Tertiary Education Union and University administrations. In exchange for this monopoly, the NTEU has a representative on the Board of UniSuper. In most instances, UniSuper is the prescribed superannuation fund, particularly for casual staff per those Enterprise Agreements. As such, choice of funds is not available to most casual employees. In some cases, tenured staff have scope to shift to other funds after a period of time, but even that is often still administered through UniSuper. That is, UniSuper will often still take a cut even where it appears as if retirement savings are invested in another fund. 

Secondly, in terms of physical power systems, individual divestment from fossil fuels is impossible. There is no truly green energy system in Australia. Nominally ‘100% renewable’ options represent financial contracting arrangements based on energy sourced from an interconnected grid that continues to be underpinned by fossil fuels. Systemic change requires broad withdrawal of financial support for high-emitting industries via institutional divestment. Industry super funds are the backbone of institutional investments.

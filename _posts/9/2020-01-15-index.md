**Fiduciary duty and company ‘engagement’ are not arguments against complete divestment.**

UniSuper will often counter demands for divestment with arguments that they have a fiduciary duty to seek the highest returns on investments. This is a false economy, particularly when companies involved in fossil-fuel extraction, circulation and consumption have managed to externalise the costs of climate change, displacing those costs on to emergency response agencies, the healthcare system, and others who bear the brunt of climate change. While UniSuper have taken some steps toward a broader, environmental and social definition of costs, they have largely used this as a means of managing the risk of divestment campaigns rather than dealing with the actual and often externalised costs of climate change.

Similarly, UniSuper have been advising members that they prefer to use investment as a means to ‘engage’ with fossil fuel companies, the argument being that serious change requires having a ‘seat at the table’. This is a line that was previously used by the ACTU to oppose divestment from the Australian detention industry. As was argued at the time, this idea relies on misrepresenting the inherently destructive and unreformable nature of detention camps and fossil fuels. As such, the appeal to “engagement” is primarily about securing access the fossil fuel industry profits and has nothing to do with any real world reduction in fossil fuel use.

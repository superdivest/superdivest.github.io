**So-called Green Funds are not a viable alternative to the divestment of large industry-based and institutional funds.**

Even if it were hypothetically possible for university staff to shift to ‘Green Funds’--and in most instances, it is not (see above)—they represent tiny pools of investments relative to the billions held by companies such as UniSuper. Additionally, using divestment campaigns as vehicles to promote ‘Green Funds’ effectively derails those divestment campaigns, transforming them into advertisements for commercial entities branded as ‘green’ or ‘ethical,’ and whose operations and investments are likely to be undisclosed. Any investment fund can brand themselves as ‘green.’ Promoting ‘Green Funds’ is in the interests of the owners of those funds, not campaigns whose objective is decarbonisation

We influence decision-makers to adopt climate-friendly policies.

We support Darwin residents to take climate action, and reduce their own climate impact.

We advocate for a transition to a zero carbon economy.

We inform and educate audiences on NT climate change impacts and solutions—including schools.

We support other local and active groups working for a safe climate:

* [Climate 4 Change](https://www.climateforchange.org.au/about)
* [Protect Country Alliance](https://www.protectcountrynt.org.au/)
* [School Strike for Climate](https://www.facebook.com/StrikeClimate/)
